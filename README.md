# Alteriss
#### A project made in PyGame

You all have surely heard of **Tetris**, the mega-successful nostalgic game. I knew a little pygame and thought of making a game in Python. This game's inspired from **Tetris** (Which is my favourite video game(Don't laugh at me))


<br>

## Features-

- This game is a refurbished version of Tetris, with different blocks which make it a lot harder
- As it's Python, supported in all OS
- The pixel graphics and the old-style interface is bound to burst nostalgia to a 80s, 90s or even a 2000's gamer

## Installation and Requirements
 
### Windows and Mac  Users-

- Visit the [Python](https://python.org) website and download your preferred python version. (Here, Python 3.8.8 is recommended)

- Make sure Python is added to PATH 

- Download the [project zip file](https://github.com/AvanindraC/Alteriss) and extract it in a folder

- Open the directory through Powershell (Windows) / Terminal (Mac) and follow the commands-

*Windows -*

```
pip install pygame==2.0.1
```

*Ubuntu and Derivatives-*

Check your installations by running both `python3 -V` and `pip3 -V` in terminal, and if both return versions, congratulations, you installed python successfully

- Now Download the project zip file and extract it to a location

- Run:

```
cd location; pip3 install pygame==2.0.1
